                  Our vast knowledge and experience in corporate law and
                  practice has availed us the opportunity of providing
                  first-rate legal support to clients, especially in several

                  We have on several occasions advised on the effect of local tax legislation on international commercial transactions and obtained regulatory consents enabling tax payment holidays. One of our Partners is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Taxation.

                  Our firm has wealth of experience and expertise in financial
                  and transactional practice. We negotiate, draft, review, and
                  advice on every kind of legal documentation and transaction.

                  We recently led the legal team that negotiated a multi-million
                  dollar Construction and Tourism-Link Relay Financing Facility
                  in favour of a Client in Owerri, Imo State Nigeria through
                  Afrexim Bank and Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM). This is
                  in addition to our ongoing participation with other firms in a
                  multidisciplinary consortium of professionals in a detailed
                  audit (legal and forensic) and ascertainment of the sum
                  unlawfully withheld from 22 states of the Federation from the
                  Federation Account. The exercise in total involves in the
                  aggregate, the recovery of well over N2 Trillion. We have also
                  acted for First Inland Bank Plc and First Bank Plc in various
                  capacities.

                  We have had to carry out due diligence on behalf of clients
                  and have also registered foreign charges on behalf of lenders
                  of capital on an ongoing and ad-hoc basis and in the process,
                  have greatly enhanced the quality of securities held. The
                  above is coupled with our vast experience in debt recovery for
                  banks, carrying out of due diligence for banks, perfection of
                  titles, releases, and mortgages for banks and other financial

                  We have seasoned practitioners with vast experience in
                  Nigerian energy and power practice. We actively participated
                  in the just concluded reforms in the power sector with the
                  unbundling of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) when we

                  consortium of other professionals for the acquisition of six

                  reviewing agreements/instruments of oil and gas transactions,
